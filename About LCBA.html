      <h1 id="STEM">ABOUT LCBA</h1>
      <h1 id="STEM">THE FOUNDER</h1>
      <p>Pedro Evangelista Llamas was born in Pagsanjan, Laguna on August 01, 1884. Both of his parents, Gabriel Llamas and Eleutera Evangelista were born and raised in the same town too.</p>
      <p>He studied in St. Joseph Catholic School in Hongkong for two years and continued his education in the United States where he received his Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Chemistry from the University of Michigan.</p>
      <p>At the young age of 28, he married Josefa Gomez Francia on August 26, 1912 and was blessed with nine children: Herminio, Guadalupe, Fidel, Amor, Luis, Jose, Mario, Carlos, and Eva.</p>
      <p>At 32, he was elected Municipal President of Pagsanjan for four years (1916–1920). He declined to be re-elected to the position, even when the townspeople wanted him to continue on, due to his health problems.</p>
      <p>In 1923, he founded the Pagsanjan Academy to serve and augment the lack of schools in his town. Later on, he realized that there was also a need for secondary schools. Children from Pagsanjan went to Laguna High School in Sta. Cruz, Rural High in Los Banos or in Manila to further their schooling. However, no one went to Calamba, as there were no secondary schools there. This thought bore fruit and thus, Laguna Institute was established in 1930.</p>
      <p>The Laguna Institute flourished amidst the havoc and strife of World War II. It closed down temporarily in 1945 and opened its doors once again in 1950.</p>
      <p>Don Pedro Llamas died January 13, 1946 at the age of 61 due to a failing heart condition. His demise was a great loss for his family and to the community. Nevertheless, his love for the Filipinos of Laguna continued on with the legacy he left with his heirs; and that is of humble servitude exemplified by providing quality education to the community. He envisioned educating the community and equipping people to become leaders leading them into abundance.</p>
